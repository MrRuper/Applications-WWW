# Bishop’s Opening - The Chess Website
The Bishop’s Opening is one of the oldest openings in chess but has fallen out of favor recently. It starts with the moves:<br>1. e4 e5
2. Bc4<br>White decides to develop the light square bishop before bringing the knight to f3. The three main responses from black are 2…Nf6, 2…Nc6, and 2…Bc5. White has good chances against each of these lines and can fall into more popular opening variations if they choose. <br>

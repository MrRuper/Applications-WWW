# Bogo Indian Defense - The Chess Website
The Bogo Indian Defense is a chess opening that arrives after the starting moves:<br>1. d4 Nf6
2. c4 e6
3. Nf3 Bb4+<br>Many players with the white pieces will choose the third move Nf3 instead of Nc3 because they want to avoid the Nimzo Indian Defense. Black has multiple options after Nf3 but Bb4+ is a common move seen at all levels of play.<br>
